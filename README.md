# dm-gen
DM Gen is a tool for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons that allows Dungeon Masters to generate, customize, and save item shops and NPCs. By inviting their players to join their DM Gen campaign, players can view item shop inventories and NPC information, as well as keep a shared notes record specific to each NPC.
